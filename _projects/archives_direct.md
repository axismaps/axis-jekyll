This small map was built as an interactive visual gateway to the Archives Direct collection. The user is greeted with an animated spinning globe (orthographic projection) that transforms into a Mollweide projected map on click. The map is linked to a list to allow for quick navigation and multiple selections can be made before submitting the results to a document search.
