We worked with the Boston region's Metropolitan Area Planning Council to design a set of Massachusetts basemap tiles for use in their various web maps. The multiscale map is designed to be distinctive yet neutral, providing reference information but not distracting from data overlays. It was designed in TileMill using state GIS data, and the styles and tiles are freely available from the MAPC.
