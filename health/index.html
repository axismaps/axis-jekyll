    <blockquote>Axis Maps worked with us every step of the way to produce a top-of-its-class mapping application, fully customized for our needs. As our project expanded, Axis Maps was able to fully accommodate our additions, building in robust new features that worked seamlessly with existing functionality. Weâ€™re thrilled with our final California Healthy Places Index map!</blockquote>

      <h4>California Healthy Places Index 2.0</h4>
      <p>Advanced workflows for expert users influencing policy</p>
    </div>
    <p>When we parterned with The Public Health Alliance of Southern California to redesign and rebuild their Healthy Places Index tool, our goal was to create an interactive online environment that support the work of a diverse group of experts that wanted to bring public health data into their work. This involved creating a highly interactive environment, akin to a guided GIS system.</p>
    <p>The initial data work for the health places index was done at the census tract level. After considering that this scale may be too granular for many of our users looking at issues beyond the hyperlocal level, we added 8 additional aggregated geography types. We also built additional back-end tools to pre-caculate and cache values for every indicator at every geography level. For users who require a higher degree of customization, we built a custom pooling system where users can select and combine individual tracts into new custom units and retrieve a score calculated on-the-fly.</p>
