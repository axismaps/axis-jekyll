We worked with the Conservation Law Foundation to create a set of three interactive maps in the context of a piece on the state and danger of natural gas leaks in Massachusetts. The first shows the location and severity of leaks; the second is a gridded map of methane emissions; and the third shows the number of leaks repaired over a two year period in Massachusetts towns and cities. The maps are embedded in a longer multimedia article, also of our making.
