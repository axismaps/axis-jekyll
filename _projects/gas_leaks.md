In the two days following the 2012 election, we made an interactive map to explore the relationship between demographics and election results. The map uses a technique called value-by-alpha, which is a bivariate choropleth map that "equalizes" a base map so that the visual weight of a map unit corresponds to a data value. For example, in the population map counties with lower populations are less visually prominent while counties with high populations remain brightly colored, giving a more accurately weighted picture of the country than a map showing a sea of red in sparsely populated areas.
