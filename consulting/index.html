      <h4>imagineRio</h4>
      <p>Custom data entry tools for an interational workforce</p>
    </div>
    <p>The backbone of the imagineRio project is a huge data-collection effort. Scholars and students in the United States and Brazil worked tirelessly to manually digitize geographic features from historic maps and geolocate historic images based on their content. The data collection processes were all done using ESRI tools including ArcGIS Pro and an ArcSDE server, but the imagineRio web-map was built using Mapnik and PostGIS (both open-source). To connect these technology platforms, we built a custom import interface that can be run from the commandline. It guides the user through a series of multiple choice questions, making sure the data they are loading gets routed to the correct place in the database. It has allowed us, with almost no special training, to give the imagineRio project staff the ability to <i>manage and maintain their project's data entirely on their own.</i></p>
    <p>As the project grew, we had an opportunity to integrate a new image repository containing thousands of historic photographs. In addition to integrating new images into the project, we also had to integrate new staff to add the new photographs to the database. As this staff was not based at a university, they did not have access to ArcGIS Pro to use the same workflow as the rest of the team. We built a custom data collection tool</p>

      <h4>ESRI ArcGIS Online</h4>
      <p>Custom color specs for a major online mapping platform</p>
    </div>
    <p>We worked with ESRI to develop an internal color-browser as a test bed for introducing new color schemes to ArcGIS Online. Over 75 custom color schemes were designed for use with thematic data on several built-in basemaps of different styles. Each color scheme is matched both to a particular kind of data and a specific basemap. The goal was to design a wide range of color schemes that would provide users with the best defaults possible when making their maps.</p>
    <p>In addition to designing the color schemes and providing detailed color specs, we wanted to make sure the color schemes could be easily communicated internally to the team implementing them in the product. To do this, we build on our experience building <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org" target="_blank">ColorBrewer</a> and designed and built a custom color browser for this project. The browser allows users to page through thematic map types, see the color schemes mapped to a test dataset, and view color specifications.</p>
