<p>We're very happy to be able to show-off our collaboration with the <a style="color: #0099cc; cursor: pointer;" href="http://www.idph.state.il.us/" target="_blank">Illinois Department of Public Health</a> and <a style="color: #0099cc; cursor: pointer;" href="http://www.ipro.org/" target="_blank">IPRO</a>. This map makes information about the quality of health in communities available to the public, highlighting socioeconomic disparities that may exist. When combined with our indiemapper platform as well as linked graphs and charts, the clinical data in the map can be used to examine the health needs of a community, county or region for better policy and planning.</p>

<p>Above is a quick demonstration video showing the basic functionality. After watching the video, check-out <a href="http://healthcarereportcard.illinois.gov/maps" target="_blank">the map itself</a>.</p>
