This is the tablet version of our Why Not the Best desktop map. Like on the desktop, this web map allows users to explore nationwide indicators of health care at the state, county, or HRR level. On the iPad, however, the focus was weighted more heavily on simplicity and ease of use. A set of core features allow users to select health indicators, tap counties and HRRs to obtain unit-specific reports, and choose the number of data classes and color scheme of the map display. We drew on the jQuery Mobile framework for a polished, iPad-app look and feel.
