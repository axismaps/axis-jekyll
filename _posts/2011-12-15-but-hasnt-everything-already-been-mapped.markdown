  content: I vividly recall a young, female bartender ridiculing me when I told her
    I was a cartographer. Although the job I held at the time paid a criminally low
    salary, I was still under the impression it outranked bartender in terms of prestige.
    Now, however, I know she was acting appropriately.

<p>In a recent post I remarked on the common reaction people have when I say that I'm a cartographer. In my experience people are usually mildly astounded and fascinated by this exotic profession (and just like that we are new best pals), and as the conversation progresses they ask if that means something like Google Maps. But sometimes it's the most dreaded, annoying question that every cartographer has heard: "hasn't everything already been mapped?"</p>
<p>There is of course a real answer to that question (perhaps it's something like, "every<em>where</em>, but not every<em>thing</em>" or perhaps it's "there's actually this one spot in Idaho we haven't hit yet"), but it's more amusing to dwell on the things we cartographers hear from our new acquaintances than on what we say in reply. In that spirit, a week or two ago I posed the following on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Survey time. Cartographers, fill in the blank based on your experience. Person: "What do you do?" You: "I'm a cartographer." Person: ______</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It generated some excellent replies. If you're not a cartographer, when you meet one remember that these are things we've all heard. If you are a cartographer, please comment to share your experiences too!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/stefanie_gray">@stefanie_gray</a> has heard several good ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>"You're a cartographer? But isn't the map done?!" (Yes, there is only one map! Ever! And it's DONE!)</p>
<p>"Why would you study cartography if every place has been discovered?" (Uh, did I say I was in 'conquistador studies'?)</p>
<p>"Hahaha making maps? On the computer? There's already Google Maps, no need for anything else!"</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/wallacetim">@wallacetim</a>'s neighbor doesn't like his prospects.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Where's the money in that?"</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kg_geomapper">@kg_geomapper</a> seems to hang around a mix of high-tech and low-tech map users.</p>
<blockquote><p>Person: [response always involves mention of either a road atlas or google maps!]</p>
<p>I also get "oh yea, I love old historical maps"</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mapgeek">@mapgeek</a> reports a modern twist on the old "hasn't everything been mapped" bit. Google did it!</p>
<blockquote><p>"But hasn't everywhere already been mapped by google?" aargh</p></blockquote>
<p>She has also, much to my horror, encountered someone who is less than impressed with cartography. And from a <em>geologist</em> at that!</p>
<blockquote><p>I also got a "god, how boring" response once!</p>
<p>I think he may have been something to do with geology! oh the irony!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/fgcartographix">@fgcartographix</a> has also found uninterested people (which is too bad, because I usually count on cartography for an easy conversation topic) but also the usual Googlers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Person: <blank stare> and then changing the subject.</p>
<p>Person: There's still area to map with Google Earth? (got that one twice...)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/desjardins">@desjardins</a> meets people who have a passing familiarity with a dictionary.</p>
<blockquote><p>"um, so what does a cartographer do?" or "that's maps or something, right?"</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/NadiiaGorash">@NadiiaGorash</a> knows a similar crowd.</p>
<blockquote><p>Person: WHO?!? Me: .... Person: I see. Mapmaker!</p></blockquote>
<p>But <a href="http://twitter.com/nichom">@nichom</a> finds people a step behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Person: <blink>< blink> (mental search for what 'cartographer' means) Me: I make maps. Person: Cool! (let fun conversation ensue)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/vtcraghead">@vtcraghead</a> points out that those with good taste (my judgment, not necessarily his) may know about cartography because of Arrested Development.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are living in the shadow of Buster: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj7RlQdF25A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj7RlQdF25A</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/clubjosh">@clubjosh</a> has figured out a good reply to the standard line.</p>
<blockquote><p>usually get the "hasn't everything been mapped" line which gets my "Yeah, but some moron keeps changing things" retort</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/g_fiske">@g_fiske</a> talks to the good ones. The ones who appreciate us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Person: "Oh, I love maps!"</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://twitter.com/musingbouche">@musingbouche</a> is not a cartographer, but knows what to say if she meets one.</p>
<blockquote><p>cool!</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I miss any? Comment on this post with any other good ones you've heard!</p>
