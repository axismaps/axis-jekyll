This map was produced as part of the Age of Exploration project in collaboration with our longtime partners at Adam Matthew Digital. It charts voyages of exploration from Bartolomeu Dias's voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 to the Arctic and Antarctic exploration voyages of the early 20th century. The data was collected by Adam Matthew editorial staff from primary source documents. This data plotted the date and location of each step of each voyage and was collected into a shared web-based relational database platform. The structure of the database:

1. Prevented unnecessary errors through strict data typing
2. Reduced data collection time by reusing location and commander data in separate tables
3. Gave the flexibility to override names and position of specific locations as ports changed over time
