"Web map" often implies a map that is not simply on the web, but rather one that is _powered_ by the web. A **digital map** is on a computer, but may not be accessible by internet, and is relatively static if it is. A **web map** depends on the internet. It is usually interactive and not always self-contained.

### Powered by the web

Web maps, in contrast to a simple static map image that resides on the web, _rely_ on the web in order to exist and function. This means one or more of a few things:

* **Web technology:** web maps are built with the technology of the web, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. (Most web maps involve at least those three in particular.) A web map runs on technology that can be consumed by standard web browsers, including, ideally, mobile web browsers.

* **Server-side communication:** a web map might rely on the internet to provide its data (say, stored in an online database) or perform calculations. This means that web maps can contain vastly more information than can possibly be presented to you at any single moment. It's quite a powerful contrast to the paper maps of old—imagine a map with such massive amounts of information as Google Maps, and trying to fold that up into your pocket!

* **Drawing from outside sources:** on the web it's not always necessary to collect all data sources in one place before mapping them—the map itself is that collection. Many data providers have APIs into which a map can tap directly every time a user views the map, eliminating the need to download all that data beforehand.

* **Real-time data:** being connected to the internet, many web maps make use of real-time, live data feeds so that they are constantly up to date on whatever they're showing. This, of course, is another thing that was never possible with traditional maps, which always necessarily represented a snapshot in time.
