    If you like, you can suggest a city at the bottom of the store's contact page: http://store.axismaps.com/contact

    We're interested to hear what other cities people would like to see when it comes time to think about making another map, so we're collecting a list through that page to help sway us in some particular direction.

<p>Earlier this month we launched our <a href="http://store.axismaps.com">new store</a> with two new typographic maps we had been working on since last autumn: <a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/typographic-map-washington-dc">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/manhattan">New York City</a> (Manhattan). These 24x36 inch posters, along with the existing line of cities, are now done in super sharp detail as offset prints, and all are now found at the new store.</p>
<p>In addition to the new cities, we also released limited edition <a href="http://www.axismaps.com/com/store/soldout.html">letterpress prints</a> of San Francisco, which managed to sell out almost immediately. We're now looking into future letterpress editions of this and other cities.</p>
<p>So if you haven't checked it out yet, have a look at our typographic maps store and all five cities for sale: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/typographic-map-washington-dc">Washington, DC</a> (new)</li>
<li><a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/manhattan">New York City</a> (new)</li>
<li><a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/typographic-map-san-francisco">San Francisco</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.axismaps.com/category/chicago">Chicago</a></li>
<li><a href="http://store.axismaps.com/product/typographic-map-boston">Boston</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, thanks to everyone for all the encouragement and support we've received for this project!</p>
