In conjunction with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy's [Imagining the Border](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=301) project, this map was developed to allow users to explore different Israeli / Palestinian land swap proposals. Complicated linework is loaded dynamically via KML and users can customize the display by adjusting the transparency of each option. Extensive settlement / community data is searchable by name to locate individual settlements in a large dataset.
