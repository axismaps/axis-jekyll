  content: "Mark,\n\nI was deliberatively provocative in my talk, of course it is
    not as simple as 2D bad, 3D good. Of course there remains a role for the graphic
    representation of geospatial data and we are beginning to see some interesting
    new visualisation techniques I would highlight the work of stamen design (http://stamen.com/)
    here.\n\nBut are stamen cartographers? \n\nWhat is been taught today on the few
    reaming cartography courses you could attend it not keeping up with technological
    developments, I hope Cartography 2.0 will help move the discipline forward, because
    we really need a \"new\" cartography for the 21st Century.\n\ned"

  content: "Hi Ed,\n\nThanks for the response and definitely agree that 'cartography'
    as it was conceptualized 20 years ago is no longer nearly enough. The world has
    moved on. I also agree that Streetview (and other immersive, augmented tools)
    are a much more powerful way to bridge the gap between 'the world' and 'our understanding
    of the world' - especially when navigating with mobile devices - since we have
    plenty of both formal and informal evidence to know traditional street maps just
    don't cut it for many map readers/tasks. \n\nWe really need folks like Stamen,
    Aaron Koblin and others to push that envelope and show us what cartography in
    the 21st century looks like (we're huge fans of their work), although I'm not
    ready yet to concede that all pre-2005 maps are dead, nor that digital/interactive
    always trumps paper/static for every map, every user, and every dataset. \n\nCheers,\nMark"

    I've got a pretty sweet blog; am I a journalist?
    Stamen is obviously worthy of praise, but to imply that their brilliance is grounds for dismissal of the core, still necessary knowledge dispensed in modern cart courses is silly. Intellectual honesty would insist that a more complete picture of mapping efforts on the web and desktop be offered up for discussion as opposed to cherry picking the shiniest example to support your claims. I would argue that Stamen excels despite formal training, not for lacking in it.
    Do cart courses need to expand their offerings? Of course. Are the basics still necessary and indeed transferable to a new medium? You bet. Just avoid the courses where "reaming" is featured @Ed P.

  content: For me, the main point you make is that there ought to be some evidence.
    What is the state of usability testing in either paleotard cartography or neo
    geography? Are people doing proper testing to Common Industry Format data or is
    nothing happening? My suspicion is the latter but I'd like to be wrong.

    Brian

    There are 40+ years of careful, peer-reviewed research on how people use maps, including topics like wayfinding, 2D versus 3D, or using photos to navigate versus using maps. Some of it has been done within cartography, some outside (e.g., HCI/V.E.). It's not complete and still very much on-going, nor am I an expert, but there are probably a hundred published papers that could help us to think about relative merits of regular street maps versus streetview. These studies span experiments from fMRI work on having folks looking at street maps through to cognitive theories spatial learning and placemaking, through to performance and usability testing across a half dozen academic fields (psychology, computer science, education, cartography, etc.). CIT could be one part of that puzzle, but again, not my area of expertise.

     My point is simple: We shouldn't make unfounded, extravagent claims without being aware of this work.

    Mark,
    Thanks for the reply. The 'science' or 'knowing stuff' about the usability of a type of product is undoubtedly useful, but the practice of Human-Centred Design as an approach to design and evaluation is what builds usable products. In the world of mobile systems, there are plenty of people working on applications where they would be able to give you good data on just how usable/fit for purpose it is.  It is my impression coming recently to the world of electronic navigation charts that although there is good research, there is not much by way of Human Centred Design happening in hydrographic offices. My suspicion is that traditional cartographic centres are much the same. Your response has got me looking, which is proving interesting.
    Your simple point is spot on. This does not need to be an evidence-free debate.

  content: "Ed and people like him benefit enormously from appearing nimble and forward-looking,
    so it helps to paint predecessors in a negative light. Witness the emergence of
    calling people \"paleo\" vs. \"neo\" in cartography. I guess in his thorough research
    on the topic he's missed the classes we teach (without reaming, thankfully) at
    my school on user-centered design, dynamic mapping, etc... \n\nUser-centered design
    &amp; evaluation is an essential part of all contemporary academic work in geographic
    visualization (since the late 90's) - whether or not this has trickled down yet
    to gov't mapping orgs and the like is debatable."

  content: "A bit late on this but canâ€™t help adding my two cents. Ed , like many
    on the â€œcutting edgeâ€\x9D of geo-spatial visualization, has no idea what a
    cartographer really is or does and assumes (wrongly) that cartography itself must
    be technologically updated to have anything to offer the new mapping dynamic.\n\nThis
    would be similar to scrapping all aeronautic understanding because we invented
    the rocket.\n\nIf every new innovation became the grounds for total displacement
    of its foundation simply because it was newer, weâ€™d never get past the first
    innovation. Cartographic principles and best practices are a major, foundational
    factor in most modern mapping, and where it isnâ€™tâ€¦ itâ€™s obvious. Cartography
    gives modern mappers the language and intellectual tools to make their innovations
    work.\nWhile there is a lot of interesting and even groundbreaking work going
    on in geo visualization today, there wouldnâ€™t be any of it without cartography
    and it wonâ€™t progress in any meaningful way without it either.\n\nI agree with
    Ed on one point, modern cartography courses, especially those attached to GIS
    programs desperately need updating. They are usually over narrow and donâ€™t reflect
    the broader understanding of geography, people &amp; place dynamics or visual
    information design that modern cartography actually practices. Cartographer is
    a word that even as it gains some greater exposure in our society is losing its
    meaning in the sense that few outside the profession understand exactly what it
    does and how it contributes to things they see and interact with every day."

<p>The title was one of the opening statements made by Google's "technology evangelist" <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/2009/11/beyond-cartography-bcs-presentation/" target="_blank">Ed Parsons</a> in a <a href="http://blog.lostinspatial.com/2009/11/04/who-killed-cartography/" target="_blank">recent talk for the British Computer Society</a>. In the talk he argues traditional street maps are bad (all of them) because they fail to engender a sense of place and because they abstract the world using map symbols. He goes on to say Streetview is good and doesn't suffer any of these problems. So is Google Earth. The take-home message is that 2D is bad! Maps symbols are bad! Photos are good! And paper is bad! [subtext: Google doesn't make paper, but if we did, we might soften our stance].</p>
<p>Here is my concern: I'm not aware of any research to support such simplistic claims. Merely saying them, repeatedly, doesn't make them true. The wayfinding research that I have seen shows that for <em>some</em> users, for <em>some</em> map reading tasks, yes, absolutely Streetview and Virtual Earths and geo-tagged photos can help. And for some users and some situations paper is better than pixels. And for some users, and some kinds of data, 2D is better than 3D. But none of those statements is a blanket truth and by outright rejecting all traditional maps in his talk--even if just for wayfinding on mobile devices--an otherwise solid argument is overshadowed by hyperbole.</p>
<p>If drug companies made arguments like these they might try to convince us by saying "Aspirin is bad. Aspirin may make your arms fall off. But our new drug has none of these problems. Use our new drug." The difference is drug companies are legally obligated to back-up their claims. It is perhaps the reason they don't employ "evangelists."</p>
<p>The deeper, more troubling message that we hear again and again is that cartography is little more than making street maps.Â  And the flip side of that coin is the only reason we use maps is for wayfinding. Streetview is very cool (it really is), but it is also pretty specialized in its uses and the advent of it does not in fact "kill cartography."</p>
<p>Cartography is more than taking photographs of a street. It's a shame that someone with this level of influence at Google has such a limited view of why we map.</p>
