As part of the New York Times' special report on the 10-year anniversary of September 11, 2001, we built a map of user-generated data that displays more than 40,000 interactive points indicating where people were on that day. Visitors to the map would drop a pin to add their own location and short comment. All users' locations were shown as dots colored according to their specified mood after reflection on the past decade, and filtering and search controls allowed for more specific views. Built-in links to post on Twitter and Facebook facilitated sharing users' stories with others.
