The University of Wisconsin Arboretum map was built with the central focus of engaging users who use the arboretum for everything from research to recreation. Users can add their own content to the map by uploading photos to Flickr or recording their experiences in Google My Maps. Researchers and arboretum staff can add their own research to the map through data managed and maintained by the arboretum staff through a flexible interface designed by Axis Maps that allows for a wide range of styling and even map animation.
