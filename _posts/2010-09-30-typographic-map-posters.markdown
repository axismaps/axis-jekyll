  content: These are incredible and I love the concept and execution, but I couldn't
    help notice that for Chicago the freeways had prominent treatment but the train
    lines were left off altogether. I'm curious, was that a conscious decision? The
    L heavily shapes my experience of the city, so a map without it just doesn't feel
    like Chicago to me.

  content: "Hi Carfree Chicago, thanks for your comments!\r\n\r\nYes, in fact, we
    had an early version of the Chicago map with the train lines on it. In that map,
    the word \"CTA\" was repeated along each line and color-coded to match the Chicago
    Transit Authority's color scheme. Where multiple lines ran in parallel, we used
    a single line with words of alternating color to save on space. Unfortunately,
    despite our space-saving efforts, we ran into trouble in places where both train
    lines and streets fully coincided. This was especially problematic in the Loop
    where the 'L' runs directly above the streets. One or the other feature had to
    go in order to keep the map legible. We were sad to say goodbye to the train lines,
    but in the end we just couldn't squeeze them in. Perhaps one day we'll make a
    larger scale version of the Chicago map that focuses on a smaller part of the
    city (The Loop to the lakefront?). This could give us the space we need for train
    lines and a bunch of other neat features as well (building footprints, Millennium
    Park attractions, etc)."

    that one with the L on it. Now I'm gonna make you dig it up from the archives!\r\n\r\nThe
    T (how nice that both these cities use single-letter nicknames for their transit
    systems) was never put to paper on the Boston map, but I'd considered trying it
    and was scared away by the same problem of lines coinciding with streetsâ€”at
    a smaller scale than the Chicago map.\r\n\r\nLarge scale maps and creative solutions
    to the space constraints would both be interesting challenges."

    Hey Andy -  So, I dug around in the archives and found an old version of the map with the train lines. As you can see, things were looking <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/posts/2010/10/cta_notsogood.jpg" rel="nofollow">not so good</a> in the loop where there's a lot of street/train overlap. However, things were <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/posts/2010/10/cta_notsobad.jpg" rel="nofollow">not so bad</a> in other parts of the city.

    Besides going with a larger scale map, the two solutions that initially came to mind when thinking about the conflict between streets and train lines were 1) displacing street and/or train routes off of their true locations to make room for both, or 2) somehow integrating the "CTA" text into the lines of repeating street names. I felt uneasy about the former and to be honest never gave the latter a whole lot of thought. But maybe something like this would be worth considering in a future version.

    Very interesting and beautiful maps, although "nothing automated about making these maps" sounds like an awful lot of work....

    Regarding the CTA routes 'colliding' with street names; Did you consider putting the CTA in reverse (coloured background with white letters)?

    That way where there was a collision the street name could take preference (in normal colour/black with appropriate background colour), but still hint that there was a train route following the same path.

    Anyhow, very impressive.

  content: Mungewell, thanks for the suggestion! I'm not sure if this is exactly what
    you're talking about (?), but I experimented with the idea on a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/posts/2010/10/cta_experiment.jpg"
    rel="nofollow">very small portion</a> of the green and orange lines. These lines
    coincide with Holden Ct. north of Roosevelt Rd (but don't collide with a street
    south of that intersection). It probably could use some tweaking here and there,
    but shows promise, I think.

    Wow, we are blown away by all the love for these maps. Thank you all for your kind words and support! How wonderful to see that other people enjoy maps as much as we do.

    @Russell - We hesitate to broadcast any ETA, but suffice it to say we're aiming for the next maps to be done <strong>much</strong> more quickly than the 20 months it took for the first couple.

    @all the city requests (here and on Twitter) - Too soon for any promises of course, but hopefully we will get to them all sooner or later!

    Just spectacular work!  That said, I think that alternative printing methods would make for even better posters.  I'm thinking (as were Joshua Taylor and firefrorefiddle) in particular about LETTERPRESS!  How perfectly elemental would that be?!?  Certainly would be more expensive, but maybe you could do a limited edition, signed and numbered letterpress run of each map for those willing to part with the extra cash?

    p.s. Really excited to see NYC.

    Sorry to slack on answering any of the questions asked in comments here; we continue to be a bit overwhelmed by all the positive response!

    When we're not busy with our usual custom interactive map work (i.e. during those dark cartography nights), we've got our hands full with the next set of cities (San Francisco, Manhattan, Washington DC), but all the requests are duly noted for the future, of course. It's great to see everybody's enthusiasm for their hometown.

    As for the few other more print-related questions, we've just stepped into this so it may be some time before we venture into fancier varieties and such, but we're definitely considering the various possibilities.

    Thanks again everyone!

    These maps are amazing and I would buy one of my home city (Indianapolis) in an instant if it were available.

    However, it seems like these maps are very labor intensive and mostly manual.  Seems like the time it would take to put one together from scratch, could be more effectively used creating a program that would do a large majority of the heavy lifting.  Obviously you'd still have to go back and make tweaks and small adjustments that a program couldn't figure out, but then you'd be using your valuable time making higher level adjustments which would ultimately increase the number of maps you could get done in a given period of time.  (There are a lot of smart programmers out there, that would love to be a part of something as cool as this.  You just gotta find them.)

    Either way, great job!

<p>Today we're pleased to show off a pet project that's been occupying us off and on for nearly two years. After some emotional separation issues, we are declaring finished a few <strong><a href="http://store.axismaps.com">typographic map posters</a></strong>â€”one of Boston, and color and black and white flavors of Chicago. Everything in these maps is made of type.</p>
<p>These look good hanging on a wall, so of course prints are available. Check out the page we've set up with some more <a href="http://store.axismaps.com">detailed images and links</a> to get copies for yourself.</p>
<p>I began this project with the Boston map, thinking it would be fun to expand the style of my small <a href="http://www.cartogrammar.com/images/aag_party_large.jpg">party announcement map</a> to a full city. The idea caught on here at Axis Maps and soon Mark and Ben had parallel effort underway for a map of Chicago, a city to which several Axis Mappers have some affinity. Ben took the lead on that map, and some twenty months later we both added our respective finishing touches and reluctantly let go.</p>
<p>There was nothing automated about making these maps, unless you count copying and pasting. Everything was laid out manually, from tracing streets over an OpenStreetMap image, to nudging curved water text, to selectively erasing text to create a woven street pattern. The Boston and Chicago maps differ in style, but the end result is similar: from a distance it can appear as an accurate reference map, and as you get closer you notice the thousands of words it comprises.</p>
<p>This has been a fun, if long, process, and we hope other people can enjoy these maps as much as we have. There are only two cities for now, but look for more in the future! Our list right now is San Francisco, New York (Manhattan), and Washington, D.C.</p>
