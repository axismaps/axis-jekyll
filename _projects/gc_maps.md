This project is made of a series of 30 static maps covering global empires and commodities from 1550 - 1945. The maps were designed as educational aides to the Global Commodities and Empires Online projects. These static maps are displayed in an interactive viewer that displays dynamically generated legends and text descriptions. The viewer also pre-loads and caches maps, allowing users to navigate by keyboard and create "pseudo-animations" of temporal content.
