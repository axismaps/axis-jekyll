<p>Looking for a more in-depth view into map projections and <a href="http://indiemapper.com/projector.html">indieprojector</a>?Â Head over to the <a href="http://indiemapper.com/blog/">indiemapper blog</a> to read Andy's post about working with geographic projections in ActionScript 3. There's a basic round-up of getting geo-data into Flash with simple projection support and a more detailed discussion about some of the challenges encountered with re-centering and polygon splitting.</p>
<p>It's a must-read if you're thinking about rolling your own geographic projection-support in AS3!</p>
