This interactive chronology was a collaborative project with Adam Matthew Digital. It features significant events in music, politics, fashion and youth culture in Britain and America between 1950-1975. Users can browse articles and images over time using an interactive timeline, as well as filter entries by particular themes and artist names. A linked bubble visualization shows the number of events in the chronology broken down by theme (i.e., bubbles) across the time period.
