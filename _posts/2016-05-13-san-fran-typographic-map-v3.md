The San Francisco poster sold out over the holidays and we’ve been eager to reprint what is perhaps our most popular typographic map. Of course, we couldn’t resist making a few changes to refresh and update the design before doing so. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s new in this, the 3rd, version of the map:

### Water areas filled with a solid color
The San Francisco Peninsula divides the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean, with the city sitting on its northern tip. To enhance the distinction between land and water and further accentuate the city and its recognizable coastline, we filled major water areas with a solid color. Text in the bay and ocean now recedes into the background while text on the peninsula rises to the foreground:

### Parks and Institutions
Text in some of the larger more recognizable parks in San Francisco, such as Golden Gate and the Presidio, was darkened to help it stand out better. These areas are important landmarks, and by increasing the contrast between them and their surroundings map readers are more quickly able to get oriented.

### Beaches
Ocean, China, Baker, Marshall, and East beaches have been added to the west and north sides of the peninsula. Because beaches tend appear as narrow strips they can be easily missed among all of the other text on the map. To counter this, we gave them a unique text style so they would stand out better. They are shown using an italic font (Museo 500 italic) and beachy-looking color, with text oriented to follow the contours of the coastline.

### Title
The redesigned title is simpler and to the point! This isn’t exactly a neighborhood map, at least not in the way of some other well-known typographic maps, nor in the way of some of our own past typographic mapping efforts (e.g., Chicago and Madison), which have shown neighborhood names and boundaries as a background layer. So, gone is the unsightly, long list of San Francisco neighborhood names that once hovered over the Pacific Ocean in favor of a cleaner space reserved for the city name alone.
