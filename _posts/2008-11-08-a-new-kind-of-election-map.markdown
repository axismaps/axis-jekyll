    I agree that the shape distortion in a cartogram takes a bit to get used to. You sure couldn't use one for navigation.

    But that's not their purpose. They are intended to show information on a different demographic basis than merely geographic area. For this I find them rather effective.

    The intensity based system is also interesting, but I feel it's less effective. For one thing, using colors, or shades of colors, is less effective than most other means of representing quantitative data. Red and blue are clear, since the electoral college makes presidential elections an all-or-nothing proposition.

  content: "Jon:\r\n\r\nConcerning the purpose of a cartogram, certainly we can't
    expect to understand accurate spatial relationships from it.  But I think the
    purpose of a cartogram has got to be a bit more than just showing data on a different
    basis, or else you're probably better off with some sort of chart.  If we complain
    about cartograms here, we're mostly talking about a certain type of cartogram,
    namely those using the Gastner and Newman method because those maps by Mark Newman
    are probably the most widely-circulated election cartograms.  (I <a href=\"http://www.cartogrammar.com/blog/i-hate-your-favorite-election-map/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">complained about</a> these recently on my personal site.)  Some
    cartograms are better than others at showing the data while maintaining reasonably
    understandable geography.\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat a matter of taste and other personal
    factors, of course, but for simply ordinal comparisons I'd take this intensity
    map over a cartogram.  Brightness is relatively easier to compare, as opposed
    to area, which I believe people are generally known to be pretty terrible at estimating.
    \ Different hues make it a bit difficult, of course, but that's the reason we
    chose to only use two (red and blue) rather than the purple color scheme you sometimes
    see.\r\n\r\nIn the end, either map&mdash;this or a cartogram&mdash;is really going
    to tell you little more than things like \"there's more blue in this area than
    that area.\" It's not easy to extract a precise quantitative value in either case."

    approach, and maybe I need to think on it. I don't find it easy to compare geographically
    separated brightnesses. Unless the two regions are abutting, the surrounding shades
    affect one's perception of the particular region.\n\nSeeing a different density
    of color makes me think at first of density of population, or perhaps strength
    of the vote in favor on one or the other candidate. Using the brightness to indicate
    population goes one step beyond, integrating the area I can see with the population
    density. This is not at all a fault of your approach, it is merely the interpretation
    which has been ingrained by the thousands of maps which precede yours.\n\nYou
    make two points that I can agree with completely (paraphrased):\n\n1. Itâ€™s a
    matter of taste and other personal factors.\n\n2. In the end, neither map is really
    going to provide observations more qualitative that â€œthereâ€™s more blue in
    this area than that area.â€\x9D"

    natural/physical phenomena in natural/physical spaces and human/social phenomena
    in human/social spaces. While cartograms may work when the number of enumeration
    units is small and their shapes/topological relations are well known, I can assure
    you that they do not work at the US county-level.\n\nI can think of two ways in
    which this view could be extremely useful for map-centered exploration and hypothesis
    generation:  \n\n(1) Visualizing a dataset in conjunction with its certainty/quality
    (here opacity=certainty). Unlike almost all other representations techniques for
    uncertainty, this would actually emphasize areas that are more certain. The eye
    would be drawn to locations of high certainty, with the darkening effect disguising
    those values that are of low certainty (and so therefore probably should not be
    seen). \n\n(2) The domain of epidemiology, where the nature of rare diseases provide
    unreliable rates in areas of small populations (opacity=population or SMR significance).
    This technique could allow epidemiologists and health service managers a representation
    that stresses high- and low-risk rates that are known to be reliable. \n\nSimple
    and effective."

    As I ruminate on these maps and compare them to the cartograms they would supplant, I am gaining a better ability to internalize their data.

    Take the ink used to color the cartogram-distorted state, and spread it (dilute it?) over the state's undistorted area. Okay, I have the paradigm in my head now, and the maps work.

    I can think of two improvements, or at least two variations I'd like to see that would aid in comprehension. 1 - use a white background instead of black, and 2 - show state boundaries to give some context to the maps drawn at county level.

  content: "The most useful maps would be ones that showed \"this portion of people
    in this region voted for Obama and this other portion in this same region voted
    for McCain\". I keep visualizing maps like a Google Earth map of a city, with
    very tall sky scrapers around Los Angeles (high population density) and some flat
    houses out in Montana. I think seeing a blue tower next to a red tower would let
    you see simultaneously who won the county and where the geographic regions most
    worth targeting are. \n\nI'd also like to see you try to put together a topographical
    map of the United States, where regions that voted for Obama are represented as
    peaks and regions that voted for McCain are represented as valleys, with ties
    as sea level. The further from sea level, the more people voted for that candidate
    in that region. That way if a region like Los Angeles was essentially a dead tie,
    it would remain flat, despite its gigantic population. But if it all voted in
    one direction, it would tower above the rest of the map. The value of this map
    would be that it would show who would've won a popular election, where are the
    big geographical social divides (there would be lots of topo lines between Travis
    and Williamson counties in Texas, for example), and it shows the regions most
    worth targeting -- the flat areas. Areas that are closest to ties are the most
    ripe for campaigning because they can A) be swung the other direction most easily
    which matters in our winner-take-all system and B) people tend to vote in groups
    and a tie means no strong consensus has been established or that there are two
    disjoint groups in the area. If it is the former then it is an area worth targeting
    for campaigns."

    in the HSV space:  (i) hue is not independent of value (yellows are brighter than
    reds), and (ii) as you reduce brightness, your range of expression narrows (the
    narrowing of the color cone).\n\nFinally, HSV is not a perceptually uniform color

    Hello,

    I am not an expert on maps or anything, I just like maps and occasionally create maps as a hobby.

    I must say that the mapping technique (Value-by-Alpha Map) that I read about here is very interesting.

    However I would like to point out one suggestion. The map (2008 US elections) shows only 2 aspects out of 3, which I think are the most important here.

    The aspects shown on the map are obviously the winning party (represented by red or blue) and the population of the county (represented by the brightness of the color).

    A 3rd, and important aspect which I think is omitted is the amount of votes for each party.
    I mean, it's not the same to label as blue or red a 51% vs 49% win and also a 95% vs 5% win.

    This aspect could be shown on the map by gradients between 100 percent blue and 100 percent red instead of just plain red or blue.

    For example if blue had 75% and red 25% then it would be a shade of purple, closer to blue than to red. This color would then be affected by the population layer, which would change its brightness.

    It would be interesting to see if such a map is easier to read and understand or it's just too cluttered and therefore hard to read.

    Of course there might be other factors, such as only a fraction of the population of a county voted, which might be taken into account.

    What do you think?

<p><em>Update, Dec. 22: A few variations of the map technique are posted <a href="http://www.axismaps.com/blog/2008/12/election-map-follow-up/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>We spent some of our spare time last week exploring data from the 2008 presidential election and thinking of some interesting ways to visualize it.  Above is one map we put together.</p>
<p>One thing we sought to do was present an alternative to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram">cartograms</a>, which are becoming increasingly popular as post-election maps.  Cartograms are typically offered as an alternative to the common red and blue maps showing which states or counties were won by each candidate, wherein one color (presently, red) dominates the map because of the more expansiveâ€”but less populatedâ€”area won by one candidate.  Election cartograms such as the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/">popular set by Mark Newman</a> distort areas to reflect population and give a more accurate picture of the actual distribution of votes. A drawback of cartograms that we're very aware of, however, is that in distorting sizes, shapes and positions are necessarily distorted, sometimes to the point of making the geography virtually unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Our map is one suggestion of a different way to weight election results on the map while maintaining correct geography.  What we've done is start with a simple red and blue map showing which candidate (Republican and Democrat, respectively) won each county in the lower 48 states.  Then, to account for the population of those counties (or, the approximate distribution of votes), we've adjusted opacity.  High-population counties are fully opaque while those with the lowest population are nearly invisible.  Against the black background, <strong>the highest concentrations of votes stand out as the brightest</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll let viewers be the judge of its cartographic effectiveness, but we hope you'll at least agree that it looks pretty cool!</p>
