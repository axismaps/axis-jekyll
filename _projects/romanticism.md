This interactive map is the fourth partnership between Adam Matthew Digital and Axis Maps LLC. Users can explore locations important to the lives and works of romantics, artists, and writers who visited and lived in the Lake District--the mountainous region in North West England that inspired their creativity. Locations are organized thematically into five separate guided tours. A custom-made media browser linked to each location contains an image viewer and audio player for examining original documents and listening to excerpts from the literature.
