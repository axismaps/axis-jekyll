In partnership with Earth Journalism Network, and made possible by a Google.org Tides Foundation Developer Grant, this map is a Google Maps Change of States API implementation. Change of States helps to document the impacts of climate change, charting the way the US is adapting to this global phenomenon. Featuring geographically contextualized news stories that link climate change to natural disasters and other environmental and even health issues, this map is be a spatial and temporal news aggregator, a rich store of information for journalists and any members of the public who are interested in exploring the correlation between climate change data and its coverage in the media.
