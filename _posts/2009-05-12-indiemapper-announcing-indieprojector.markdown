  content: Looks great... when or where have you posted documentation?  I am very
    interested to use this, to give each nation a specific value from a data set I
    have developed. Thanks!

<p>Today, we are pleased to announce the release of our free geographic projection and data conversion tool: <a href="http://projector.indiemapper.com" target="_blank"><strong>indieprojector</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For indieprojector, we took three core indiemapper features:</p>
<ol>
<li>SHP / KML import</li>
<li>Geographic projections</li>
<li>SVG export</li>
</ol>
<p>... and combined them into a single stand-alone web application. Indieprojector lets you load multiple SHP or KML files, reproject them to one of 11 geographic projections and export them to SVG for use in a vector graphics editing program. We've also included lots of information on each projection plus filtering tools to help you select the best projection for your individual project.</p>
<p>We're very excited to be offering a preview of indiemapper before it's release at the end of the summer and we hope indieprojector is useful for your day-to-day mapping work. Check out the <a href="http://indiemapper.com/projector.html">indieprojector screencast</a> and please take some time to <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/axismaps/products/axismaps_indieprojector">give us some feedback</a> and let us know what you think. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Enjoy <a href="http://projector.indiemapper.com">indieprojector</a>!</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong>Â A new version of indieprojector has been released which includes support for NetworkLink tags in KML, layer re-ordering and various minor UI and bug fixes.</p>
