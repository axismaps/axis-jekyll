This project with Adam Matthew Digital includes fourteen animated maps of the key fronts, battles and campaigns of World War I. Three additional interactive maps invite users to explore the war in terms of its global context (e.g., effects of the war on national boundaries). The maps have been arranged along a master timeline that provides temporal context as well as serving as a central navigational element. A selection of primary source documents is available for viewing alongside the maps using a built in image viewer.
