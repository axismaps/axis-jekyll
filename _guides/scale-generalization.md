Cartography is all about abstraction. It is not possible to show every detail, especially at small scale ("small scale" = zoomed out, "large scale" = zoomed in). Thus a map requires [generalization](http://www.gitta.info/Generalisati/en/html/index.html). This process is fundamentally what makes maps useful: stripping away or suppressing unimportant things to the map's purpose and clarifying important things.


Common generalization tasks include:

- Selection: choosing which objects to include on the map
- Simplification: reduce the number of vertices in an object
- Smoothing: reduce sharp angles to smoother curves
- Aggregation: group points into areas
- Amalgamation: group areas into larger areas
- Collapse: reduce a detailed object to a point symbol
- Merge: grouping of line features
- Refinement: select only portions of an object to display
- Exaggeration: amplify a part of an object (for clarity)
- Enhancement: add detail that visually elevates an object
- Displacement: separate objects (for clarity)
