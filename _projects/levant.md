diverseLevant is an online mapping platform that illustrates the urban evolution of Beirut, over its entire history as well as across its social, cultural, and religious diversity. Primary sources, such as views of the city, historical maps, archeological surveys, and architectural projects are located in time and in space while their associated visual and geographic data are integrated across a number of databases, including an open-access digital library of images, a geographic information system, an open source relational database, and a content delivery web service.
