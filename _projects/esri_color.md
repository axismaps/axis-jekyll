We worked with ESRI to develop an internal color-browser as a test bed for introducing new color schemes to ArcGIS Online. Over 75 custom color schemes were designed for use with thematic data on several built-in basemaps of different styles. The browser allows users to page through thematic map types, see the color schemes mapped to a test dataset, and view color specifications.
