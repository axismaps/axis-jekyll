To help evaluate the effectiveness of their programs, the Duke University Children's Environmental Health Initiative contacted us to build a visualization system that lets them compare health, demographic and program data. The dual, linked choropleth maps display separate variables that can be manipulated using the adjoining histogram and pie charts. The system is fully extensible so CEHI's GIS staff can continue to add and update their own data as it becomes available.
