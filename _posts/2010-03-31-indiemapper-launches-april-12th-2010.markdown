<p>After months and months of non-stop design and development, the release of indiemapper is imminent. We're all palpably excited about this product and can't wait to get it in everyone's hands. Thanks to everyone who has provided their invaluable expertise and enthusiasm along the way.</p>
<p>We'll be spending the next 12 days fine-tuning indiemapper for launch. You can head over to <a href="http://indiemapper.com" target="_blank">http://indiemapper.com</a> for full details. Also, be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/axismaps" target="_blank">@axismaps</a> on twitter as we start to introduce you to all the new stuff we've been working on.</p>
